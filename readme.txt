== Description ==

Creates 4 feeds : 
    trdf => rdf in theme (template : feed-rdf.php)
    trss => rss 1.0 in theme (template : feed-rss.php)
    trss2 => rss 2.0 in theme (template : feed-rss2-comments.php and feed-rss2.php)
    tatom => atom in theme (template : feed-atom-comments.php and feed-atom.php)

Those feeds look for a feed template into the theme directory.
If no template is found into the theme directory the feed uses the default wordpress feed template.
